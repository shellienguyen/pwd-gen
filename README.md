To generate a random password based on user criteria.  Upon clicking on the "Generate Password" button the
user is greeted with a series of prompts to indicate whether to include lower case characters, uppercase
characters, special characters, and/or numbers in the password.  The site will then generate a password for 
the user based on those chosen criteria.
